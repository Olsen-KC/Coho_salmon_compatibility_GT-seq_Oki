# Open Data Resource: Genetic compatibility shapes reproductive success in hatchery-origin coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). 
## This repository contains the data files and R scripts used in analyses for the submitted manuscript titled above. 
## Objective: Evaluate the reproductive success of genetically informed and random crosses of hatchery-origin coho salmon using genetic parentage analysis, generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), and genotyping-in-thousands by sequencing (GT-seq).
## Coho_salmon_compatbility_analysis_script.HTML: Written summary of the analysis, R code, and pre-rendered figures. 
## Coho salmon_compatbility_R_project: R project that can be downloaded for running or manipulating code. 
## filtered_GTseq_genotypes: GT-seq genotypes of crossed and returning coho salmon.
## parent_pairs: Metadata and genotypes of crossed parents and marker information.  
## COLONY_results: Formatted input files and result ouput file from genetic parentage analysis with the program COLONY.
